All our code will be made available through the projects GitHub repository. We are currently not sharing the link to protect the blind peer-review process.

Attached is a subset of the supplementary material:

- The interpolation methods as Processing functions
- Visualizations of all extracted positions (note that mTOUCH is referred to as MICROCHIP here)
- The processed data used to generate the visualizations and used in the statistical analysis. (03_Normalized_Data)
- An Excel Sheet with all Error, Deviation, and Correlation measurs. 
---> This sheet includes Pivot Tables for exploring all parameter combinations (note that mTOUCH is also referred to as MICROCHIP here)

Not included here, but available in our GitHub repository:

- The raw data (Original 10 bit readings from the Arduino + precise z-axis values, timestamps etc.)
- The pattern generator used to create the electrode designs
- The full Processing sketches used for processing and visualizing the data
- The Javascript program used for collecting the data
- A prototype simulation tool for testing new sensor patterns
- Additional visualizations of the raw data (rather than visualizations of extracted positions)
